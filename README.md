# How to use this project

Everything in this project is executed through a Makefile, in the terminal you should always execute:
make target. For example:

"make SortedArray"

Here are the target commands, explained:

* p1_test  
Runs tests on algorithms in part1.
* p2_test  
Runs tests on algorithms in part2.
* p1_exp  
Runs the experiment for part1.
* p2_exp  
First runs the tests for part2, then it runs the experiment for part2.
* clean  
Deletes all the .class files in the bin.
* SortedArray  
Runs the SortedArray in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
* SearchTree  
Runs the SearchTree in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
* OtherArray  
Runs the OtherArray in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
* RankSelectNaive  
Runs the RankSelectNaive in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
* RankSelectLookUp  
Runs the RankSelectLookUp in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
* RankSelectSpaceEfficient  
Runs the RankSelectSpaceEfficient in a given testcase and prints the Algorithms answer along with the actual answer
