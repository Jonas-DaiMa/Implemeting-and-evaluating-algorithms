Question/Hypothesis: 
We expect that OtherArray will be the fastest of the 3 implementations SortedArrray, SearchTree & OtherArray
with respect to average running time per query.

Performance Indicators:
Average Running time per query

Factors (potential):
Alpha, n (size of S), 
size of e in S, 
q (several x queries),
Seed,
SBST(Alpha, n, q)

Levels:
Alpha = 0 ... 1 by ? (Only use 3 values in pilot),
n = 2^9 ... 2^17 by *2,
q = [e1 ... ei ... em] (size of q= min(n+1); e1 < S[min]; ei = random; em = S[max]),

Trials:
10000 per Design Point

Design Points:
Changing alpha and algo

Outputs:
??? Think this has to do with explanation of levels.

----------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
    - All algo must take input same way (maybe need a "build" function)
    - Build should not be counted in timing
    - Ensure correctness of results while running
    - Block size can have effect, only for OtherArray

Experiments to perform:
    - Figure out n and q, values
    - Fix n and q over and check algo over different alpha

Remember to check if index ever becomes negative.
